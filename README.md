# bare-metal-diffusion

Two builds of the Heat2D demo live side by side:

- `uefi/` — the original UEFI app that runs before the OS on Raspberry Pi 5 (see `uefi/Heat2D_RPi5_UEFI_Heat_Diffusion_Demo_with_QEMU.md` for build/run notes).
- `metal/` — a new bare-metal Circle-based build for Raspberry Pi 5 with improved typography and runtime-selectable color schemes.

Each folder contains its own README with build and deployment instructions.
