# Bare Metal & UEFI Heat Diffusion

This repository now contains two flavors of the Heat2D experiment:

- **`uefi/`** – the original UEFI-focused versions of the application.
- **`metal/`** – a Raspberry Pi 5 bare-metal rewrite that uses Circle-style abstractions to drive a framebuffer UI with mouse and keyboard support.

See `metal/README.md` for build, emulation, and usage details for the bare-metal target. The legacy UEFI documentation lives in `uefi/`.
